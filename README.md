## Detection and Classification of Thyroid disease using Ultrasound images through Deep Learning

- Abstract: 
           The thyroid gland produces hormones that regulate your body's metabolism. There are various disorders that can arise when your thyroid secretes too much hormone. The shape and size of the thyroid gland changes when it is affected making thyroid segmentation essential in the diagnosis of thyroid related diseases. The existing systems use image-based features to characterize the thyroid tissue by direction working on the image pixels and focus on algorithms which use techniques such as edge detection, thresholding, region splitting and merging, watershed segmentation resulting in a low SNR and resolution. Deep learning plays a decisive role within the method of illness prediction and this paper handles the analysis and classification models that area unit getting used within the thyroid illness based on the information gathered from the dataset taken from UCI repository. It is important to ensure a decent knowledge base that can be entrenched and used as a hybrid model in solving complex learning tasks, such as in medical diagnosis and prognostic tasks. In this project we have proposed different machine learning and deep learning techniques for the detection of thyroid diseases. In the proposed system, we are using K-means clustering for segmentation, Convolutional neural network to train and test and model which would help in classification as well as the localization of the disease part in the ultrasound image of the thyroid gland.
